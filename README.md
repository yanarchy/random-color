Random Color Generator

## about
This was one of the first things I'd ever coded (circa May 2014)--before I knew what git or github was and when I was just barely getting the hang of jQuery. I recently dug it up and gave it a tiny bit of styling. The integrity of the old code I wrote is still there--all I did was indent lines properly.

I purposefully kept this simple because when I was getting started, it was so hard to find repos that weren't decked out with sass, servers, and grunt.

## tech
A tiny bit of jQuery.
